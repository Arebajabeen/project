    <p class="right"> <span>Right to education (RTE) has made a long journey since it’s inclusion as a principle of policy to its recognition as a fundamental human right in the Constitution of Pakistan as Article 25-A. Free & quality compulsory education for all is a crucial but unfulfilled promise for over 50% of 5-16 year old children in the country. Having the lowest spending on education in South Asia <em>(UNESCO GEM Report 2017)</em>, Pakistan is currently ranked at 150 out of 189 countries in

      <ol>
        o	Ensure equitable resource allocation for inclusive education.
      </ol>
      <ol>
    o	Improve systems  for efficient and effective utilisation of the development budget at all levels by developing a planning and implemention framework at local level that includes local goverments, education managers and Schools Management Committee.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        o	Rationalize the budget according to specific needs of each individual school, with special focus on schools in far flung areas and the ones lagging behind in gender parity and inclusivity.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        o	Per child cost must be calculated and budget should be allocated accordingly with an emphasis on gender budgeting, taking account of facilities required by adolescent girls.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        o	Increase both the development and non-salaried budget significantly to ensure more middle and high schools with better infrastructure and facilities.
